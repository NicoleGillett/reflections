When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you're collaborating with other people, for example, or working from different computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Again, you could be collaborating with others and not ready for their changes. Alternatively, you might prefer to pull a bunch of changes in one go, rather than individually.
